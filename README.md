On this Android App you can take a picture or draw a sketch, and it will tag the image and use Claude to create a story describing the image. It is the beginning concept of a mobile app that could help a visually impaired person navigate a new environment.

This app combines functional use of the camera, background services, accessibility functions like text-to-speech, Google Cloud Vision, and TextCortext's API for accessing Claude.
